# SoLong
This is the first graphic project at [42](42sp.org.br), a very small 2D game.

### What is SoLong?
SoLong is an individual project at [42](42sp.org.br) that requires us to create a very small 2D game. It is built to make you work with textures, sprites and some very basic gameplay elements using [MinilibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux), a simple X-Window [(X11R6)](https://www.x.org/wiki/X11R6/) programming API in C, designed for students, suitable for X-beginners.
